            <ul>
                <li class="head2"><b>Interoperability:</b> With different healthcare providers using different systems to store
                    medical records, it can be challenging to exchange information between different systems. However, a
                    blockchain application for health records management has the potential to provide a standardization
                    that could improve interoperability and make it easier to exchange information between different
                    systems</li>
                <br>
                <li class="head3"><b>Increased Data Accuracy:</b> Blockchain's immutable ledger ensures that once data is entered into
                    the system, it cannot be altered without proper authorization. This helps to maintain the accuracy
                    of medical records and ensures that patients receive the right treatment based on the most
                    up-to-date information.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="head4"><b>Better Data Accessibility:</b> By using blockchain technology, medical records can be stored in a
                    decentralized network and accessed from anywhere, at any time. This makes it easier for healthcare
                    providers to access and update patient information, improving the speed and efficiency of healthcare
                    processes.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="head5"><b>Improved Data Security:</b> Blockchain technology offers a secure and decentralized method of
                    storing and sharing medical records. By using cryptographic algorithms, it makes it virtually
                    impossible for unauthorized users to alter or access sensitive information, providing a high level
                    of data security.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="head6"><b>Increased Patient Control:</b> Patients can have more control over their health information as
                    they can decide who has access to it and can authorize its use. This gives patients more control
                    over their health data and helps to ensure that it is used for the right purposes</li>
